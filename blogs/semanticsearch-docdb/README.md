**<u>Semantic Search using vector search for Amazon DocumentDB</u>**

This notebook helps you explore semantic search using vector search for
Amazon DocumentDB. You will need a working Amazon DocumentDB database
connection and a Hugging Face (HF) access token to successfully run this
notebook . In this notebook, we use open source Hugging Face Inference
API, so that it is easy for you to learn and test.

To setup your Amazon DocumentDB, please visit [Get Started with Amazon
DocumentDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/get-started-guide.html).

To get HF access token, sign up to create a new account or log-in with
existing account on [HF website](https://huggingface.co/). Next,
navigate to the "Access Tokens" section under “Settings”. To obtain your
Access Token, initiate the creation of a new token by selecting "New
Token" and assigning it "read" rights. Once created, you can use this
token for authentication when accessing the HF inference API.
